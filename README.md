# Cooking Recipe Application

I will be building this app to help me practice building a CRUD application that interacts with a Node.JS RESTful API.


# TO-DO:
* Add support for optional nutrition fields when adding ingredients
* Paginate fetched ingredient results
* Change IngredientList so user can only edit and delete ingredients belonging to them
