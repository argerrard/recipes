# Cooking Recipe Application

I will be building this app to help me practice building a React/Redux CRUD application that interacts with a Node.JS RESTful API.


# TO-DO:
* Add support for optional nutrition fields when adding ingredients
* Paginate fetched ingredient results
* Change IngredientList so edit and delete buttons are only shown to users with the ability to do the actions
* Add sign-up functionality
* Add validation to login
